## 📒 Description

Immo-eliza-scraping is a Python program designed to scrape property listing data from immoweb, Belgium's leading real estate website. It gathers the unique listing URL for each active listing and then retrieves specific property data from each of the listings. The property data is then compiled into a CSV file for later use in data analysis, visualization, model training, and pricing forecasts.

## 📦 Repo structure

```
.
├── src/
│ └── scraper.py
├── main.py
└── README.md
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the `main.py` file to execute the scraper:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

4. The program will retrieve data about active real estate listings from the immoweb webpages and then scrape the property details from each listing. The resulting data will be saved to a CSV file named "real_estate_listing_data.csv" in the root directory.

5. The total execution time will be displayed in the terminal upon completion, estimated at ~6 minutes.
